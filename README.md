# 📰 Sustain Insight – Backend

This is the **backend service** for the News Aggregator project.
It is built with **Spring Boot** and uses a **Neon PostgreSQL cloud database** for both development and production.
Configuration is **environment-driven** (`.env` + `application.yml`), keeping secrets out of the repo.

---

## ✨ Features

* REST API for news articles, categories, sources, bookmarks, and user preferences
* User authentication with JWT
* Environment-based config with `.env` and Spring profiles
* CORS configuration for frontend integration
* Deployed backend connected to Neon DB (no local DB needed)

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* Java 21
* Spring Boot (Web, Data JPA, Security, Validation, Actuator)
* PostgreSQL (via Neon)
* Maven

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

Run the following command depending on your platform, replacing placeholders "< VALUES >" with your actual configuration values.
These include database (Neon), server, CORS, pagination, and news fetching settings.

### macOS / Linux (bash/zsh)

```bash
export PGHOST= <your-neon-host>
export PGPORT= <your-port>
export PGDATABASE= <your-database>
export PGUSER= <your-username>
export PGPASSWORD= <your-password>

export SERVER_PORT=8080
export CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,https://sustain-insight-front-end.vercel.app

export NEWS_API_KEY= <your-news-api-key>
export FEED_HOURS_WINDOW= 24
export PAGINATION_DEFAULT_SIZE= 9
export PAGINATION_MAX_SIZE= 50
export LATEST_DEFAULT_LIMIT= 5
export LATEST_MAX_LIMIT= 20
export NEWS_FETCHING_ENABLED= false

```

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
setx PGHOST "<your-neon-host>"
setx PGPORT "<your-port>"
setx PGDATABASE "<your-database>"
setx PGUSER "<your-username>"
setx PGPASSWORD "<your-password>"

setx SERVER_PORT "8080"
setx CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS "http://localhost:5173,https://sustain-insight-front-end.vercel.app"

setx NEWS_API_KEY "<your-news-api-key>"
setx FEED_HOURS_WINDOW "24"
setx PAGINATION_DEFAULT_SIZE "9"
setx PAGINATION_MAX_SIZE "50"
setx LATEST_DEFAULT_LIMIT "5"
setx LATEST_MAX_LIMIT "20"
setx NEWS_FETCHING_ENABLED "false"

```

Spring Boot automatically maps these environment variables into `application.yml`.

```

### 4. Verify health endpoint

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
# → {"status":"UP"}
```

## 👥 Collaboration Workflow

* **Feature branches:**
  Use dedicated branches like:

  * `feature/auth`
  * `feature/articles`
  * `feature/cors-config`

* **Development branch (`dev`):**

  * All work is merged into `dev` via PRs.
  * Requires review and passing checks.
  * Acts as the integration branch before production.

* **Main branch (`main`):**

  * Production-ready branch, directly used for deployment.
  * PRs from `dev` are squashed and merged into `main`.

* **Branch protections:**

  * PRs required for merges.
  * No direct commits or force pushes to `main` or `dev`.
  * Status checks and reviews required.

## 🔒 Security Notes

* Secrets are provided via environment variables — never hardcoded.
* Only placeholder instructions are included in README.
* Neon DB credentials and JWT secrets must be provided per environment.
* If secrets are exposed in Git history, rotate them immediately.
